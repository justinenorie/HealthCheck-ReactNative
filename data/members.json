        "description" : "I learned about UI/UX design principles, including element spacing, typography, and content block usage, and applied these concepts using Figma to create a design for our system. After designing, I used React Native to build a working mobile application, applying the basic concepts of the framework. I implemented navigation for accessing different pages, styled the application, and created various interactive pages. I also practiced version control by uploading the project to GitHub and followed best practices for file organization, ensuring the code is easy for others to understand."
